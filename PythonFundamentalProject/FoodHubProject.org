Problem Statement - FoodHub

*Submission type*: File Upload

*Due Date* : Oct 19, 5:30 AM CDT

*Total Marks* : 60

*Available from* Sep 26, 9:30 AM

*Description*

*Context*

The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of
students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their
hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for
them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A
food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants
through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a
customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up
the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person
then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food
package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person,
he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's
location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off
in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The
customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money
by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.

*Objective*

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders
made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to
analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different
restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience.
Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data
Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be
answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions
that will help the company to improve the business. 

*Data Description*

The data contains the different data related to a food order. The
detailed data dictionary is given below.

Data Dictionary

- order_id: Unique ID of the order

- customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food

- restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant

- cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer

- cost_of_the_order: Cost of the order

- day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or
  weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is
  Saturday and Sunday)

- rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5

- food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to
  prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between
  the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery
  person's pick-up confirmation.

- delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to
  deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference
  between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation
  and drop-off information

 

*Submission Guidelines*

1. There are two ways to work on this project:

*i. Full-code way: *The full code way is to write the solution code from
scratch and only submit a final Jupyter notebook with all the insights
and observations.

*ii. Low-code way*. The low-code way is to use an existing solution
notebook template to build the solution and then submit a business
presentation with insights and recommendations.

The primary purpose of providing these two options is to allow learners
to opt for the approach that aligns with their individual learning
aspirations and outcomes. The below table elaborates on these two
options.

| Submission type | Who should choose                                                                                                                                         | What is the same across the two                                                             | What is different across the two                                                                             | Final submission file [IMP]                                                                 | Submission Format |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
| Full-code       | Learners who aspire to be in hands-on coding roles in the future focussed on building solution codes from scratch                                         | Perform exploratory data analysis to identify insights and recommendations for the problem  | Focus on code writing: 10 - 20% grading on the quality of the final code submitted                           | Solution notebook from the full-code template submitted in .html format                     | .html             |
| Low-code        | Learners who aspire to be in managerial roles in the future-focussed on solution review, interpretation, recommendations, and communicating with business |                                                                                             | Focus on business presentation: 10 - 20% grading on the quality of the final business presentation submitted | Business presentation in .pdf format with problem definition, insights, and recommendations | .pdf              |

Please follow the below steps to complete the assessment. Kindly note
that if you submit a presentation, ONLY the presentation will be
evaluated. Please make sure that all the sections mentioned in the
rubric have been covered in your submission.

*i. Full-code version*

- Download the full-code version of the learner notebook.

- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the
  project.

- Clearly write down insights and recommendations for the business
  problems in the comments.

- Submit only the solution notebook prepared from the learner notebook
  [format: .html]

*ii.* *Low-code version* 

- Download the low-code version of the learner notebook.

- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the
  project.

- Prepare a business presentation with insights and recommendations to
  the business problem.

- Submit only the presentation [format: .pdf]

2. Any assignment found copied/plagiarized with other submissions will
not be graded and awarded zero marks.

3. Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will
not be accepted for evaluation.

4. Submission will not be evaluated if

- it is submitted post-deadline, or,

- more than 1 file is submitted.

 

*Best Practices for Full-code submissions*

- The final notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments
  explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing
  comments on the observations and insights.

- The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner
  before submission.

- It is important to remove all warnings and errors before submission.

- The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a
  notebook file (.ipynb).

- Please refer to the FAQ page for common project-related queries.

 

*Best Practices for Low-code submissions*

- The presentation should be made keeping in mind that the audience will
  be the Data Science lead of a company.

- The key points in the presentation should be the following:

  - Business Overview of the problem and solution approach

  - Key findings and insights which can drive business decisions

  - Business recommendations

  - Focus on explaining the key takeaways in an easy-to-understand
    manner.

  - The inclusion of the potential benefits of implementing the solution
    will give you the edge.

- Copying and pasting from the notebook is not a good idea, and it is
  better to avoid showing codes unless they are the focal point of your
  presentation.

- The presentation should be submitted as a PDF file (.pdf) and NOT as a
  .pptx file.

- Please refer to the FAQ page for common project-related queries.

FAQ - FoodHub

*1. How should one approach the FoodHub project?*

- Before starting the project, please read the problem statement
  carefully and go through the criteria and descriptions mentioned in
  the rubric.

- Once you understand the task, download the learner notebook and the
  dataset to get started with the project.

- Many parts of the learner notebook are omitted and replaced with
  questions. You are expected to fill in the gaps as per the
  instructions/questions. Try to use descriptive statistics and
  visualization to understand the data.

- Once the EDA is completed, it is important to close the analysis with
  key findings and recommendations to the business.

 

*2. Is there a way to transfer the graphs from Colab to the presentation
without it looking blurry?*

There are multiple ways to transfer the graphs.

1. Use the following line of code just after the visualization code:

plt.savefig("output.jpg", bbox_inches='tight')

For example:

sns.histplot(data=data, x='column')\\
plt.savefig("output.jpg", bbox_inches='tight')

2. Use the snipping tool to snip the visual plot from the Jupyter
notebook and paste the snip in ppts.

3. Right-click on the image and click on copy and paste the copied plot
in the ppt or document.

  

*3. How should the presentation look like?*

The presentation should be made keeping in mind that the audience will
be the Data Science team of an organization and should focus on
explaining the key takeaways in an easy-to-understand manner. The
visualizations used should be readable and it is better to avoid showing
codes unless they are the focal point of your presentation.

 

*4. In Question 14, do we need to add the cost of the orders while
calculating total revenue?*

The *total revenue* should be calculated based on the applied surcharges
only.
