*Description*

*Background and Context*

AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority
of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying
sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset
customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this
base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn
more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants
to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan
customers (while retaining them as depositors).

A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a
healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the
retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target
marketing to increase the success ratio.

You as a Data scientist at AllLife bank have to build a model that will
help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who
have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

*Objective*

To predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans, to
understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving
purchases, and to identify which segment of customers to target more.

*Data Dictionary*\\
​* ID: Customer ID\\
​* Age: Customer's age in completed years\\
​* Experience: #years of professional experience\\
​* Income: Annual income of the customer (in thousand dollars)\\
​* ZIP Code: Home Address ZIP code.\\
​* Family: the Family size of the customer\\
​* CCAvg: Average spending on credit cards per month (in thousand
dollars)\\

Advanced/Professional\\
​* Mortgage: Value of house mortgage if any. (in thousand dollars)\\
​* Personal_Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in
the last campaign?\\
​* Securities_Account: Does the customer have securities account with the
bank?\\
​* CD_Account: Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD)
account with the bank?\\
​* Online: Do customers use internet banking facilities?\\
​* CreditCard: Does the customer use a credit card issued by any other
Bank (excluding All life Bank)?

*Submission Guidelines*

1. There are two ways to work on this project:

*i. Full-code way: *The full code way is to write the solution code from
scratch and only submit a final Jupyter notebook with all the insights
and observations.

*ii. Low-code way: *The low-code way is to use an existing solution
notebook template to build the solution and then submit a business
presentation with insights and recommendations.

The primary purpose of providing these two options is to allow learners
to opt for the approach that aligns with their individual learning
aspirations and outcomes. The below table elaborates on these two
options.

| Submission type | Who should choose                                                                                                                                         | What is the same across the two                                                             | What is different across the two                                                                           | Final submission file [IMP]                                                                 | Submission Format |

| Full-code       | Learners who aspire to be in hands-on coding roles in the future focussed on building solution codes from scratch                                         | Perform exploratory data analysis to identify insights and recommendations for the problem  | Focus on code writing: 10-20% grading on the quality of the final code submitted                           | Solution notebook from the full-code template submitted in .html format                     | .html             |
| Low-code        | Learners who aspire to be in managerial roles in the future-focussed on solution review, interpretation, recommendations, and communicating with business |                                                                                             | Focus on business presentation: 10-20% grading on the quality of the final business presentation submitted | Business presentation in .pdf format with problem definition, insights, and recommendations | .pdf              |

Please follow the below steps to complete the assessment. *Kindly note
that if you submit a presentation along with the notebook, ONLY the
presentation will be evaluated.* Please make sure that all the sections
mentioned in the rubric have been covered in your submission.

*i. Full-code version*

- Download the full-code version of the learner notebook.

- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the
  project.

- Clearly write down insights and recommendations for the business
  problems in the comments.

- Submit only the solution notebook prepared from the learner notebook
  [format: .html]

*ii. Low-code version *

- Download the low-code version of the learner notebook.

- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the
  project.

- Prepare a business presentation with insights and recommendations to
  the business problem.

- Submit only the presentation [format: .pdf]

2. Any assignment found copied/plagiarized with other submissions will
not be graded and awarded zero marks.

3. Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will
not be accepted for evaluation.

4. Submission will not be evaluated if

- it is submitted post-deadline, or,

- more than 1 file is submitted.

 

*Best Practices for Full-code submissions*

- The final notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments
  explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing
  comments on the observations and insights.

- The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner
  before submission.

- It is important to remove all warnings and errors before submission.

- The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a
  notebook file (.ipynb).

- Please refer to the FAQ page for common project-related queries.

 

*Best Practices for Low-code submissions*

- The presentation should be made keeping in mind that the audience will
  be the Data Science lead of a company.

- The key points in the presentation should be the following:

  - Business Overview of the problem and solution approach

  - Key findings and insights which can drive business decisions

  - Business recommendations

  - Focus on explaining the key takeaways in an easy-to-understand
    manner.

  - The inclusion of the potential benefits of implementing the solution
    will give you the edge.

- Copying and pasting from the notebook is not a good idea, and it is
  better to avoid showing codes unless they are the focal point of your
  presentation.

- The presentation should be submitted as a PDF file (.pdf) and NOT as a
  .pptx file.

- Please refer to the FAQ page for common project-related queries.

 

Happy Learning!

FAQ - Personal Loan Campaign

**** *1. How should one approach the Personal Loan Campaign project?*
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: how-should-one-approach-the-personal-loan-campaign-project
:END:
- Before starting the project, please read the problem statement
  carefully and go through the criteria and descriptions mentioned in
  the rubric.

- Once you understand the task, download the dataset and import it into
  a Jupyter notebook to get started with the project.

- To work on the project, you should start with data preprocessing and
  EDA using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

- Once the EDA is completed and data is preprocessed, you can use the
  data to build a model and check its performance.

- It is important to close the analysis with key findings and
  recommendations to the business.

**** *2. Decision Tree arrows are missing, how to fix this?*
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: decision-tree-arrows-are-missing-how-to-fix-this

Use the following code as a reference to resolve the issue and make
necessary changes (name of the model, feature names, etc):

plt.figure(figsize=(20,30))

out =
tree.plot_tree(model,feature_names=feature_names,filled=True,fontsize=9,node_ids=False,class_names=None,)

​#below code will add arrows to the decision tree split if they are
missing

for o in out:

arrow = o.arrow_patch

if arrow is not None:

arrow.set_edgecolor('black')

arrow.set_linewidth(1)

plt.show()
